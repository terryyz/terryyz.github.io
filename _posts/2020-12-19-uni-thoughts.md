After a two-year study @UNSW, I have some kinda meaningful thoughts about my study and my life. I tried different ways to study and met different people inside the class and outside as well.

Ways to study
======
There are so many ways to study. However, all of theses methods can be classified into two: classroom-study and self-study.  

Classroom-study mainly gives you some insights of potential fields you may be interested in but doesn't provide in- depth information. This is quite crucial to the students who haven't developed their interests. It's worth mentioning that everyone may take a different length of time to find his/her own path in life. Therefore, you should be ashamed of yourself not having found anything valuable and meaningful when others have started their own adventures. Try hard but patiently find your meanings during your classroom-study!  

Self-study is the second stage after touching something you might be interested in. Sometimes, the one appealing may not be your true destiny. Hence, self-study is the way to explore whether it is the one you are looking for or just something related. From my personal experience, self-study told me that pure signal processing or quantum computing is not my real interest and I should find more; later, it let me know I could be more interested in natural language processing than speech processing. But who knows if natural language processing is my final destination or just a stop in my life!

Personally, I try not to spend most of the time on classroom-study after I found something promising in 2019 -- quantum computing and signal processing.  


You can have many headings

Aren't headings cool?
