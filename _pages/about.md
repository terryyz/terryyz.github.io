This is Terry Yue Zhuo [@MONASHINFO](https://umlt.infotech.monash.edu/) & [@UNSW](https://www.unsw.edu.au/).

[**My Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=terryzhuo25%40gmail.com&ctz=Australia%2FSydney)

**My Rules**:
* I spend 3-4 weeks (out of 12 weeks) in total on my coursework during each term and the rest of my time doing cool things and chilling.
* I work hard during my vacations but take breaks (try not to do course study) during my uni time :) 
* Keeping WAM above HD is only because it is the requirement of PhD scholarships.
* D.W.I.C (doing well in class) is never enough!
